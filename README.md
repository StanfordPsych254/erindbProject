# Experiment to replicate in this project

## Main project

Paper: Walsh & Sloman (2004)

Experiment: Experiment 2

## Secondary project

On the off chance that the main project is straightforward enough that
I have extra time and energy left over, I have a secondary project
that I could do from Psych Science.

Paper: (possibly) Madore, Addis, and Schacter (2015)

Experiment: Experiment 1
