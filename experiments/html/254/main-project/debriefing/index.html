<p>In this experiment, we were interested in how people resolve contradictions to causal beliefs. If usually one thing causes another, but in a particular situation it does not, then are other potential effects of that cause also less likely to happen? If so, does this revision of our beliefs generalize to other situations, too?</p>
<p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.386.4779&rep=rep1&type=pdf">This paper</a> found that people do revise their beliefs about other effects in the same situation and in different situations from the contradiction. We are attempting to replicate this finding.</p>
