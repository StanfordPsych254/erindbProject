things to do:

* attention checks
* debriefing document
* playback experiment
* pilot semi-naive subject
* graph original & pilot results
	* recreate the graph that the autors used *and* a graph that describes the data best
* writeup any additional issues
* sent pilot a (direct link & rendered markdown) to instructors for approval
* pending approval, run pilot b with 4 naive Ss
* push repository to open science framework & preregister

things to probably not do:

* secondary project :(

notes:

* log transform RTs
* moderators and planned analyses for differences between replication and original
* SECURE: email subject
