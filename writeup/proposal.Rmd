## Introduction

I'm still looking for a paper. I'll have one by the end of today.

## Justification

I'm interested in doing research on explanation and representation of causal relationships. I didn't see a lot of relevant papers in Psychological Science (2015). There was one neuro paper on what areas of the brain are involved in social explanation and several papers that elicited coarse information about people's lay theories of various domains (many of which other students are planning to replicate). I'm going to keep looking for papers outside of last year's Psych Science, and I'll add a paper to this proposal once I have (by tonight, hopefully).
